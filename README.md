Better edline -> edline/
========================

###Type: Userscript

This is a pair of userscripts that I use to make edline more usable.  Added functionality:
- Shows the grade next to the class on the private report menu
- Adds colors corresponding to grades
- Adds assignments viewing menu where they are sorted by category
